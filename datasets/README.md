| **Primary Drains** | Map depicting Storm Drainage Network under BBMP | The map of SWDs has been georeferenced. Please refer to page 3 of the CAG report for SWD map. The primary and secondary drains were digitised to produce files in GIS format. The data can be downloaded from Interactive map. | [CAG Performance Audit - Open City](https://data.opencity.in/dataset/cag-performance-audit-of-stormwater-drains-in-bengaluru/resource/cag-performance-audit-of-stormwater-drains-in-bengaluru) |
