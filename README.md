# Building A Resilient Bengaluru
# The Bengaluru Stormwater Ecosystem Interactive Map

" When we see how water flows in our cities, we understand where our city breathes — resilience begins with awareness."

The Bengaluru Stormwater Ecosystem Interactive Map is a flexible and interactive web based GIS software to quickly visualize spatial data layers from a variety of data sources.

The map is currently deployed at the following urls:

## Background - The Campaign

Bengaluru stands at a critical crossroads. Once sustained by a man-made ecological network of tanks, lakes, and rajakaluves, the city nurtured thriving water ecologies, economies, and productive landscapes. Over time, however, rapid urbanisation has severed this relationship. Lakes were filled, stormwater canals narrowed, and the systems that once safeguarded the city against floods steadily dismantled. Each monsoon now exposes the cost of this neglect: inundated neighbourhoods, disrupted livelihoods, and a growing vulnerability across the urban fabric.

The Building a Resilient Bengaluru campaign, initiated by the Mod Foundation, responds to this urgency. Rooted in our ethos of making cities observable, the campaign seeks to bring visibility to the often-overlooked systems that keep Bengaluru alive - its waterways. It is the culmination of years of work on the K100 Citizens’ Waterway Project, which reimagined a neglected stormwater canal as a public, ecological, and cultural asset. 

By combining institutional reform with placemaking, the K100 project became a proof of concept that influenced the World Bank’s INR 3000 crore investment in Bengaluru’s flood resilience.By combining institutional reform with placemaking, the K100 project became a proof of concept that influenced the World Bank’s INR 3000 crore investment in Bengaluru’s flood resilience (August 2024).

Our campaign extends these learnings citywide. By creating **a shared knowledge base of strategies, technical insights, and citizen-led practices**, we aim to empower people to see waterways not as backdrops or drains, but as vital infrastructures for health, ecology, and culture. We believe that resilience cannot be engineered by mega projects alone. It must be co-created through collective action, informed citizens, and transparent governance.

Building a Resilient Bengaluru is more than a campaign, it is a call to reclaim the city’s relationship with water. By observing and reimagining the systems beneath our feet, we can shape a Bengaluru that is not only flood-resilient but also equitable, ecological, and future-ready.
A part of Building a Resilient Bengaluru Campaign, Stormwater & the City is a 12-month initiative to develop an interactive digital dashboard that maps Bengaluru’s stormwater drainage network (Rajakaluves) across physical, urban, and governance dimensions. Storm Water Drains (SWDs) are critical for flood mitigation, public health, and water quality, yet remain invisible in planning and public discourse, often reduced to mere open drains. 

Stormwater & the City positions information as the first, crucial step toward action. One that aligns Bengaluru’s resilience ambitions with inclusive, participatory community engagement. This project aims to make Storm water networks visible and legible through a user-friendly, **participatory dashboard that enhances transparency, encourages civic engagement, and fosters collective stewardship**. Drawing inspiration from the citizen-led revival of Bengaluru’s lakes, this initiative envisions a similar transformation in the perception and management of stormwater infrastructure.

In July 2025, Mod Foundation in collaboration with Oorvani Foundation won a grant for this project. This project is funded by Bengaluru Sustainability Forum (BSF).
