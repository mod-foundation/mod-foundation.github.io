# Building a Resilient Bengaluru

" When we see how water flows in our cities, we understand where our city breathes — resilience begins with awareness."

Bengaluru’s relationship with water is one of ingenuity disrupted by urban expansion. Once sustained by a network of lakes, tanks, and rajakaluves (stormwater channels), the city enjoyed a decentralized system that conserved water and mitigated floods. These interconnected waterways balanced ecology and community life.

The late 19th century shifted this balance. Piped water from distant reservoirs reduced reliance on local sources, while rapid expansion led to lakes being filled for development. Colonial and post-colonial governance reframed lakes from community commons - supporting fishing, agriculture, and grazing - into landscaped amenities for the elite. Sampangi Lake’s transformation into a regulated park exemplified this exclusion.

The consequences are stark. Encroachments, poor planning, and unchecked infrastructure have disrupted lake connectivity, turning rajakaluves into sewage channels. Once-seasonal water bodies now stagnate under effluents and waste. Frequent flooding and water shortages expose decades of neglect and fragmented governance. The Building a Resilient Bengaluru campaign responds by treating water systems as essential infrastructure and shared public spaces. 

The K100 project, as a proof of concept, demonstrates that stormwater drains can be reimagined as active corridors - linking bus stops and metro stations, enabling community gardens, and providing walkable routes to schools. By aligning infrastructure with everyday urban life, K100 has fostered community ownership and reduced solid waste accumulation.

Collaboration has been key - government departments, NGOs, and communities working together to restore not just drains, but trust and accountability.

The larger challenge lies ahead. Bengaluru’s ~842 kms of stormwater drains form the city’s hydrological spine, yet remain poorly maintained and encroached. With climate change bringing erratic rainfall and frequent floods, the city must shift from piecemeal projects to a city-wide strategy that restores waterways as urban commons.

Waterways are not problems to engineer away, but living systems to protect and reimagine for resilience, equity, and public life.

## About

A part of Building a Resilient Bengaluru Campaign, Stormwater & the City is a 12-month initiative to develop an interactive digital dashboard that maps Bengaluru’s stormwater drainage network (Rajakaluves) across physical, urban, and governance dimensions. Storm Water Drains (SWDs) are critical for flood mitigation, public health, and water quality, yet remain invisible in planning and public discourse, often reduced to mere open drains. 

Stormwater & the City positions information as the first, crucial step toward action. One that aligns Bengaluru’s resilience ambitions with inclusive, participatory community engagement. This project aims to make Storm water networks visible and legible through a user-friendly, participatory dashboard that enhances transparency, encourages civic engagement, and fosters collective stewardship. Drawing inspiration from the citizen-led revival of Bengaluru’s lakes, this initiative envisions a similar transformation in the perception and management of stormwater infrastructure.

In July 2025, Mod Foundation in collaboration with Oorvani Foundation won a grant for this project. This project is funded by Bengaluru Sustainability Forum (BSF). The first step towards making stormwater network visible was to map and understand the typologies along SWDs. This workshop was conducted on 11th October, 2025 at BLR Design Centre. Students, professionals and RWA members came together to map and understand SWDs and their typologies.
